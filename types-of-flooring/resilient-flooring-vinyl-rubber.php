	<h3>Overview</h3>
	<p>Resilient flooring can provide looks similar to hardwood, terrazzo, ceramic and stone at a more affordable price. With tiles, sheet goods, and planks as well as optional water jet cutting of patterns and logos the design options are virtually unlimited. There are also multiple installation methods available depending on the product and application (floating, adhesive, heat welding of seams, and flash coving to create an integral sanitary base.) DMA Floors has been installing resilient flooring for over 30 years. We understand that what lies beneath is as important as the finish. We also have extensive experience with heat welding, flash coving and installing custom designs.</p>
