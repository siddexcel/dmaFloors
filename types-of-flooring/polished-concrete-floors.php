	<p>Aggregate exposure class denotes the surface exposure after grinding and polishing operations. The density, size and distribution of the aggregates at the surface depends on the concrete mix design and placing and finishing operations. Floor flatness at the time of grinding and polishing operations is an important consideration in selecting the appropriate aggregate exposure class.</p>
	
	<p>Surface exposure percentages are based on visual observation of the overall area of the polished floor.</p>

	<p>Caution: This provides a visual representation of the differences in Class A, B and C. This may not represent the polished concrete in your area as it varies based on aggregate type, gradation, size and distribution.

	<p><span><strong>Polished concrete</strong></span> is an elegant, resilient, sustainable alternative to floorcoverings and epoxies. It can be used in a variety of spaces in government / military, <a href="/polished-concrete-for-corporate-offices.html">corporate / office</a>, <a href="/polished-concrete-for-education.html">educational</a>, <span>healthcare</span>, <a href="/polished-concrete-for-hospitality.html">hospitality</a>, <a href="/polished-concrete-for-manufacturing.html">manufacturing</a>, and <a href="/polished-concrete-for-retail.html">retail</a> settings. The process provides increased strength over standard concrete as well as most floorcoverings and many resinous systems. With the addition of pigmented stains and decorative saw cuts the look of natural stone, or tiles can be achieved with lower installed, maintenance and life cycle costs. Sealed, stained, and epoxy coated concrete are sometimes confused with polished concrete. While each of these treatments has benefits, none of them perform like polished concrete. Polished concrete mechanically <span>transforms the concrete</span> through the use of hardening agents and grinding with diamond tooling. There are no coatings to chip, scratch, or fail, the shine you see is the concrete.</p>
	
	<p><strong>Polished concrete</strong> is the processing of a concrete surface with bonded abrasives to achieve a desired class of aggregate exposure and level of reflective clarity and reflective sheen.
