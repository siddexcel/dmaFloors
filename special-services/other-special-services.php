                <h3><span>Shot Blasting</span></h3>
                <p>Shot blasting can be used to create a profile in the floor for resinous and moisture mitigation systems to bond to. It can also be used to remove some coatings and prepare for some other floor finishes. We use a large 15” Blastrac machine that is extremely efficient and has an integrated dust collection system to help you maintain clean air.</p>

                <img src="/forDMA/images/additional-services/saw-cutting.webp" alt="" srcset="">
                <h3><span>Decorative Saw Cutting</span></h3>
                <p>Decorative saw cutting can be used to provide delineation between colors or to create designs or patterns in the slab. We can use it in conjunction with staining and joint filling to create dramatic effects, borders, the appearance of grout lines, or to outline a logo or text. If you can imagine it, we can probably cut it.</p>

                <h3><span>Decorative Staining</span></h3>
                <p>We offer decorative concrete stain applications using dye stains, acid or reactive stains and topical stain systems. Decorative stains can be applied using stencils or within saw cut areas to provide color to designs, patterns and logos. Stains can also be used to change the color of an entire area. Staining can be performed in conjunction with polished concrete or it can be sealed using a variety of sealers depending on your intended use.</p>

                <h3><span>Topical Polishing Systems</span></h3>
                <p>While topical polishing systems do not provide the same level of wear resistance and durability that a true polish does, they can be used in some low traffic environments when a specific look is desired and a budget will not permit a true polish.</p>
