	<h1>Additional Services</h1>
	 <p class="intro">At DMA, we pride ourselves in being able to help you get the look and performance that you want from your floor. We have a few technical services that we offer that further demonstrate why DMA is your best choice. Even if we are not installing your floorcovering, we will be more than happy to help you with any of the following services.</p>
  <div class="main-wrapper2 grid">
	<div class="content-block saw-joint"><h3>Saw Joint Filling</h3>
		<img src="https://trimediaus.com/forDMA/images/additional-services/joint-filling.webp">
		<p>Open saw joints can store dirt and debris. We can fill them with semi-rigid joint filler and shave them level with the floor to prevent this. Colored joint filler can be used to create accents as well.</p>
    </div>
	<div class="content-block decorative-saw"><h3>Decorative Saw Cutting</h3>
		<img src="https://trimediaus.com/forDMA/images/additional-services/saw-cutting.webp">
		<p>Decorative saw cutting can be used to provide delineation between colors or to create designs or patterns in the slab. We can use it in conjunction with staining and joint filling to create dramatic effects, borders, the appearance of grout lines, or to outline a logo or text. If you can imagine it, we can probably cut it.</p>

	<div class="content-block shot-blasting"><h3>Shot Blasting</h3>
		<img src="https://trimediaus.com/forDMA/images/additional-services/large-shot-blaster.webp">
		<p>Shot blasting can be used to create a profile in the floor for resinous and moisture mitigation systems to bond to. It can also be used to remove some coatings and prepare for some other floor finishes. We use a large 15” Blastrac machine that is extremely efficient and has an integrated dust collection system to help you maintain clean air.</p>

	<div class="content-block decorative-staining"><h3>Decorative Staining</h3>

		<img src="https://trimediaus.com/forDMA/images/additional-services/ameripolish-colorjuice-system.webp">
		<p>While topical polishing systems do not provide the same level of wear resistance and durability that a true polish does, they can be used in some low traffic environments when a specific look is desired and a budget will not permit a true polish.</p>
