		<h3>Considerations for Production Areas<</h3>
<div class="left"><img title="DMA Floors considerations for production areas" alt="manufacturing production areas" src="/images/manufacturing-production-areas.jpg" height="183" width="275" style="margin-right: 30px; margin-bottom: 20px; float: left;"></div>
<ul class="tabs">
<li>What will the floor be exposed to (fats, oils, acids, alkalis, temperature variations, and other production by-products and cleaners can destroy concrete and some coatings and finishes.)</li>
<li>Is this a replacement of an existing floor (if the existing floor is degraded, the thickness of the system and any reinforcement needs to be considered in order to maintain structural integrity.)</li>
<li>Does the flooring system need to meet regulatory guidelines (USDA, FDA, DOE approved)</li>
<li>What are your requirements for slip resistance, aesthetics, LEED, ESD, thermal shock?</li>
<li>What sort of phasing schedule can be implemented for the install? Some systems can be installed in a relatively short period of time during a shut down, while others may require multiple phasing while closing down sections to install.</li>
<li>Is secondary containment required in a certain area? How do the previous considerations apply?</li>
<li>When specifying&nbsp;<a href="/types-of-flooring/resinous-flooring-epoxy-floors-urethane.html">resinous systems</a>, it is imperative to consider&nbsp;<a href="/special-services/floor-preparation.html">slab finishing techniques, surface prep, transitions, and crack, joint, drain and termination detail</a>.</li>
