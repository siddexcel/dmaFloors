<li>Urethane cements/slurries can be installed from 3/16” to 3/8” and provide a durable, chemical, slip and thermal shock resistant surface.</li>
<li>High solids thin mil systems (<a href="/types-of-flooring/resinous-flooring-epoxy-floors-urethane.html">epoxy</a>, urethane, polysaspartic) can be applied with or without traction enhancing aggregate or aluminum oxide for added abrasion resistance.</li>
<li><a title="Resinous Systems for Manufacturing Companies" href="/types-of-flooring/resinous-flooring-epoxy-floors-urethane.html">Epoxies</a>&nbsp;tend to have lower resistance to UV exposure so if they are used in areas where they are subject to UV exposure they should be finished with a urethane or polyaspartic.</li>
<li>Polyurea is a thick film coating that can be spray applied to provide a flexible, seamless, waterproof, chemical, tear, impact and abrasion resistant surface that can bridge moving cracks to 1/8”.</li>
<li>There are electro static discharge options available.</li>
<li>Proper preparation of the floor is imperative to the performance and aesthetics of the system installed.</li>
<li>Transitions, drain, edge and joint/crack detail must be addressed and properly specified.</li>
