<p><strong>Manufacturing and industrial facilities are typically designed with one thing in mind, efficiency of production.</strong> While this is vital since efficiency of production means lower cost of production and increased profits, the one system that often receives little consideration is the floor. We overlook the importance of what is under our feet, wheels, and equipment, until that system fails and we trip, our wheels don’t turn, or our equipment is no longer resting on a firm foundation. In food processing, or pharmaceutical facilities, governmental regulations dictate that we have “proper” flooring for sanitary purposes, but in cases where regulations do not guide us, we often expect a sealed concrete floor to handle all that we can drop on it, but it rarely does.</p>
