	<p>Whether an international presence, a boutique hotel, or a bed and breakfast, a hotel has to develop and promote a strong brand identity. With all of the choices of where to stay, what can we do to make sure that your facility is peoplesâ€™ first choice? Many of the details that draw people to a particular brand or facility are out of our hands, but appearances count for a great deal and we can provide that. Guest room flooring is typically replaced every five years and common areas every 10-15 years, though some brands call for updating more often to maintain a clean, fresh look and a competitive edge. Floor coverings need to be durable and help reduce maintenance costs. When specifying for remodels, the replacement needs to be able to move forward with as little operational disruption as possible.</p>
