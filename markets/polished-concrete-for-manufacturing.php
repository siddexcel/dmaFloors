<li><a href="/types-of-flooring/polished-concrete-floors.html">Polished concrete</a>&nbsp;will harden and increase the slip and abrasion resistance of bare concrete, as well as reduce dusting, helping to keep an area brighter, cleaner, safer, reduce maintenance costs and increase the life cycle of the concrete.</li>
<li><a href="/types-of-flooring/polished-concrete-floors.html">Polished concrete</a>&nbsp;is not typically used in areas that will be exposed to chemicals or acids.</li>
<li>Saw joints should be filled with a semi-rigid polyurea joint filler to help with ease of maintenance.</li>
